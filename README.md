We've simulated BARRET, our construction material-transporting UGV, using Webots. 

### Steps to Run the Simulation

1. Download Webots [(here)](https://cyberbotics.com/#download).
2. Open Webots. Then go "File", then "Open World" and open one of the world files contained in the worlds directory.
3. Pause and then reset the simulation. Then press start to start the simulation from the beginning.
